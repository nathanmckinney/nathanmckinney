#### Long time listener / first time caller
Finally learning how to actually use this Github after just using it to steal everyone's code for years.

#### ABOUT
Trained as an Environmental Scientist (MS, Univ West Florida), I currently manage the geospatial infrastructure for the University of Tennessee Department of Geography. 

#### AND THE SUGGESTED QUESTIONS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on microtopography change measurement & detection using UAS and terrestrial LiDAR.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning proper use of python instead of muddling through borrowed code.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything. Pitch me, I'm useful.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with also most anything. That's the downside of knowing a little about a lot of things.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about obscure 90s indie rock.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mckinney@utk.edu 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: money can be exchanged for goods and services.
